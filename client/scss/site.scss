// ** below here add as little css as possible **
// **********************************************
// This is the css that people using the project will really need
// to study.  The rest of the project is handled by the 'framework'.

//components scss
	// This is for honest to goodness components
		// components are either reused or have special functionality
		// that makes sense to keep clearly by itself
//@import "components/...";

//partial scss
	// Partials just represent a part of a page
	// these are usually not repeated or they would be components
//@import "partials/...";

//page scss - should be highest level of override
	// often nothing or very little will be page specific
	// overrides for components and partials on particular pages will go here
//@import "pages/...";
